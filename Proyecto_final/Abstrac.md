This study investigates the ergonomic impact of university seating on students’ musculoskeletal health, focusing on lumbar muscle fatigue during prolonged study sessions. Using surface electromyography (sEMG) with BiTalino devices, the research compared muscle activation in ergonomic and non- ergonomic chairs over three-hour periods. The methodology in-volved signal processing techniques including Wavelet Daubechies 6 filtering, normalization, and RMS value extraction. Results suggest that non-ergonomic seating may be associated with increased lumbar stress, while ergonomic chairs showed no signs of muscle fatigue. However, the study faced limitations due to interruptions and uncontrolled environmental factors. The findings highlight the potential benefits of ergonomic seating in academic settings and underscore the need for further research under more controlled conditions to definitively establish the relationship between seating ergonomics and musculoskeletal disorders among university students.
